# Engine Displacement Conversion App
Android app created to work on skills, currently it converts from metric units like liters (L) or cubic centimeters (cc) to cubic inches (cu in or CID), units usually use to measure the volume displacement in engines.

When the app opens up it starts as a cc converter and it will convert to liters and cubic inches when you enter a whole number (cc measurements are usually whole number measurements) and press the 'convert' button. two buttons at the bottom of the screen will convert either from liters or from cubic inches into the other units depending which one you click.
